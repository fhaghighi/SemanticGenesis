Arizona Board of Regents, for and on behalf of Arizona State University, a body corporate (“Licensor”) offers its “Learning Semantics-enriched Representation via Self-discovery, Self-classification, and Self-restoration” project (Tech ID no. M20-239L) (the “Work”) and related Data solely for non-commercial use under the following terms and conditions:
1. Definitions.
      "License" means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work and the Data set forth in this document.
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or entity exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form means the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form means any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
      “Data” means the data compilation(s), data set(s), and database(s) made available by a Contributor under the License.
      "Work" shall mean the work(s) of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as identified above.
      "Derivative Works" means any work, whether in Source or Object form, that incorporates, is based on, or is otherwise derived from the Work or from any other Derivative Work or Data authorized under this License and whereby such work  constitutes, as a whole, a separate original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works do not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work, the Data, and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner of the submission or by an individual authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.  With respect to Data, Contribution includes data sets, data compilations, and databases intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in or for use in connection with the Work by the owners of the submission or by an individual authorized to submit on behalf of the owner.  For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, revocable (as stated in this section) right to perform any or all of the following actions solely for academic and other non-commercial research purposes: reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.  Any person or entity wishing to make a commercial use of the Work or a Derivative Work must enter into a separate written agreement with the Licensor and, in the case of a Derivative Work, any other applicable copyright owner of that Derivative Work. For the avoidance of doubt, no licenses to use the Work for commercial or for-profit purposes are granted hereunder.  If Licensor determines in its sole discretion that You have exceeded the scope or otherwise breached the terms of the License granted herein, it shall have the right to terminate the License in addition to all other remedies available to it under common law, by statute, and in equity.

For the avoidance of doubt, no licenses to use the Work for commercial or for-profit purposes are granted hereunder.  If You institute patent litigation against any individual or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work or such Contribution shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  If Licensor determines in its sole discretion that You have exceeded the scope or otherwise breached the terms of the License granted herein, it shall have the right to terminate the License in addition to all other remedies available to it under common law, by statute, and in equity.

Any person or entity wishing to make a commercial use of the Data must enter into a separate written agreement with the Licensor and, in the case of a Derivative Work, any other applicable owner of that Derivative Work.  For the avoidance of doubt, no licenses to use the Data for commercial or for-profit purposes are granted hereunder.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work and/or Data, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work and/or Data otherwise complies with all the terms and conditions stated in this License;
     (f) With respect to Licensor’s Data, you must cite to Licensor’s research papers – namely, “Learning Semantics-enriched Representation via Self-discovery, Self-classification, and Self-restoration” - whether or not such papers are identified in any NOTICE text file accompanying the Data.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in or use with the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate agreement you may have executed or may execute with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor.    Pursuant to nominative fair use principles, you may merely identify Licensor as the original author of the Work and Data, as applicable.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work and its Data (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND.  LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHER (INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE), AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
